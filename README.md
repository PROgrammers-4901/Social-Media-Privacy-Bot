BEFORE DOCKER IS SET UP THIS IS HOW TO RUN

    Open terminal in the root folder:
    `npm run install-dependencies` - to install dependencies
    `npm run start-frontend` - to run the frontend
    `npm run start-backend` - to run the backend


DOCKER INSTRUCTIONS

    Download and install the latest version of Docker

    Open terminal at the root of the project (where docker-compose.yml is)
    `docker-compose build` to build the images (you need to do this every time you make changes to the program)
    `docker-compose up` to start the container

    The frontend is available now at localhost:3000
    The backend is available now at localhost:5000

    `docker-compose down` to shut down the container
